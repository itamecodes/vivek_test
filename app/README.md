Things that could have been done better
1. Ideally I should have added placeholder images for icons
2. Master detail view could be shown alongside on tablets
3. As of now on first launch, the app downloads the data from the server and caches it and uses it. Ideally there should be a
time period after which the data is considered stale and new data is downloaded.
